# Life Balance Wheel - Monthly Check-In Tool

## What is this?

Okay so basically this is a visual tool for checking in with yourself about how different areas of your life are going. You know how sometimes everything feels "off" but you can't put your finger on what exactly? This helps with that.

You rate 8 different life areas from 1-10 and it creates this wheel shape that shows you where things are good and where they might need some attention. It's like a quick visual snapshot of your life balance (or imbalance, let's be real).

## How to use it

1. Just open the HTML file in your browser. That's it. No installation, no dependencies, nothing fancy.

2. Move the sliders to rate each area based on how you're ACTUALLY feeling, not where you think you should be:
   - 1-3 = struggling hard
   - 4-5 = meh, could be better
   - 6-7 = decent, getting there
   - 8-9 = pretty good actually
   - 10 = crushing it

3. Watch the wheel update in real-time. The shape tells you a lot:
   - Small and spikey = some areas great, others not so much
   - Small and round = everything's kinda meh
   - Big and round = you're doing amazing sweetie
   - Lopsided = time to redistribute some energy

4. Pro tip: You can also click directly on the wheel to adjust values if you're feeling fancy

## Why I made this

I kept seeing these life wheel things online but they were either:
- Behind a paywall
- Required signing up for some coach's newsletter
- Way too complicated with like 20 categories
- Super corporate and weird sounding

So I made my own. Simple, free, no BS.

## When to use it

- Monthly check-ins (first Sunday of the month works well)
- When you feel overwhelmed and need clarity
- Before setting goals or making big decisions
- When something feels "off" but you can't figure out what
- Annual reviews or birthday reflections
- Or literally whenever you want

## The reflection questions

After you fill it out, there are some questions to help you actually DO something with the information. Because let's be honest, awareness without action is just... depressing.

The questions focus on:
- Noticing patterns without judging yourself
- Picking ONE small thing to work on (not everything at once)
- Recognizing what's actually working well
- Making connections between different areas

## Technical stuff (for nerds)

- Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- No frameworks, no dependencies
- Canvas API for the wheel visualization
- Responsive design with CSS Grid
- Local storage isn't used (privacy first)
- About 600 lines of commented code
- Works in all modern browsers

## Want to customize it?

Go for it! The code is pretty well commented. Some easy tweaks:
- Change the categories to whatever makes sense for your life
- Adjust the colors (look for the gradient definitions)
- Add more or fewer categories (you'll need to adjust the angles)
- Change the low threshold (currently set to 5)
- Translate it to another language

## Privacy

This runs 100% in your browser. Nothing is saved anywhere, nothing is sent to any server. When you refresh, it resets. If you want to save your results, use the print/save button to make a PDF.

## License

Do whatever you want with this. Seriously. Share it, modify it, sell it (good luck with that lol), put it on your website, use it in your therapy practice, whatever helps people.

## Bugs or ideas?

Feel free to open an issue or submit a PR. Or don't. I'm not your boss.

## Final thoughts

Remember: This is just a tool for reflection. Your wheel being "imperfect" doesn't mean you're failing at life. We're all just doing our best here. Sometimes that means having a weird spikey wheel, and that's totally fine.

The point isn't to have a perfect circle. It's to notice where you might want to put some energy and then take ONE small step. That's it. That's the whole thing.

Take care of yourself out there ✌️
